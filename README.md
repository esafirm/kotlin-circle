## Circle

Circle first and foremost is a collection of libraries for full Kotlin Multiplatform development.
It is created for prototyping, demo and educational purpose.

Other than that, it provides a thin layer to make dev more easier to remember the APIs for
common usage such as:

- Storage
- Image Loading
- Navigation

Not that **convenience** is the priority in this layer.

**This library is not intended for production usage**. Instead, use the transitive libraries
directly based on your needs.
